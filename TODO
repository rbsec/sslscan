Fix session resumption test
    We have a false positive for session resumption
    IDs are assigned but not accepted for resumption

Fix XMPP scans that do not support StartTLS:
    "<stream:error><invalid-namespace xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-streams'/></stream:error>"
Add HTML report generation
Add diff between reported and actually supported ciphers
Make a Debian package
