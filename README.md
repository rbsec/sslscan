# README

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rbsec/sslscan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rbsec/sslscan)

This is a fork of ioerror's version of sslscan (the original readme of which is included below). Changes are as follows:

* Highlight SSLv2 and SSLv3 ciphers in output.
* Highlight CBC ciphers on SSLv3 (POODLE).
* Highlight 3DES and RC4 ciphers in output.
* Highlight PFS+GCM ciphers as good in output.
* Highlight NULL (0 bit), weak (<40 bit) and medium (40 < n <= 56) ciphers in output.
* Highlight anonymous (ADH and AECDH) ciphers in output (purple).
* Hide certificate information by default (display with `--get-certificate`).
* Hide rejected ciphers by default (display with `--failed`).
* Added TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 support (merged from twwbond/sslscan).
* Compiles if OpenSSL does not support SSLv2 ciphers (merged from digineo/sslscan).
* Supports IPv6 hostnames (can be forced with `--ipv6`).
* Check for TLS compression (CRIME, disable with `--no-compression`).
* Disable cipher suite checking `--no-ciphersuites`.
* Disable coloured output `--no-colour`.
* Removed undocumented -p output option.
* Added check for OpenSSL HeartBleed (CVE-2014-0160, disable with `--no-heartbleed`).
* Flag certificates signed with MD5 or SHA-1, or with short (<2048 bit) RSA keys.
* Support scanning RDP servers with `--rdp` (credit skettler).
* Added option to specify socket timeout.
* Added option for static compilation (credit dmke).
* Added `--sleep` option to pause between requests.
* Disable output for anything than specified checks `--no-preferred`.
* Determine the list of CAs acceptable for client certificates `--show-client-cas`.
* Experimental build support on OSX (credit MikeSchroll).
* Flag some self-signed SSL certificates.
* Experimental Windows support (credit jtesta).
* Display EC curve names and DHE key lengths with OpenSSL >= 1.0.2 `--no-cipher-details`.
* Flag weak DHE keys with OpenSSL >= 1.0.2 `--cipher-details`.
* Flag expired certificates.
* Flag TLSv1.0 ciphers in output as weak.
* Experimental OSX support (static building only).
* Support for scanning PostgreSQL servers (credit nuxi).
* Check for TLS Fallback SCSV support.
* Added StartTLS support for LDAP `--starttls-ldap`.
* Added SNI support `--sni-name` (credit Ken).
* Support STARTTLS for MySQL (credit bk2017).

### Building on Windows
Thanks to a patch by jtesta, sslscan can now be compiled on Windows. This can
either be done natively or by cross-compiling from Linux. See INSTALL for
instructions.

Note that sslscan was originally written for Linux, and has not been extensively
tested on Windows. As such, the Windows version should be considered experimental.

Pre-build cross-compiled Windows binaries are available on the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan/releases).


### Building on OS X
There is experimental support for statically building on OS X, however this
should be considered unsupported. You may need to install any dependencies
required to compile OpenSSL from source on OS X. Once you have, just run:

    make static

### OpenSSL issues

#### OpenSSL 1.1.0 Support
OpenSSL 1.1.0 introduced a number of significant changes, including the removal
of old and insecure features such as SSLv2. While this is a very good thing for
the SSL ecosystem as a whole, it is a problem for sslscan, which relies on
these legacy features being available in order to detect them on client system.

In order to work around this, sslscan builds against [Peter Mosmans'](https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl)
fork of OpenSSL, which backports the Chacha20 and Poly1305 ciphers to OpenSSL
1.0.2, while keeping the dangerous legacy features (such as SSLv2 and EXPORT
ciphers) enabled.

### TLSv1.3 and the future of sslscan

Since the OpenSSL made the (very sensible) choice to remove support for legacy
and insecure protocols and ciphers, sslscan has relied on a fork of OpenSSL by
[Peter Mossmans](https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl) which provided support
for both these legacy ciphers and newly added ciphers (such as ChaCha). However,
this fork of OpenSSL does not support TLSv1.3. To my knowledge there is no
version of OpenSSL which supports both the legacy crypto (SSLv2, EXPORT ciphers,
etc) and TLSv1.3 - which means that it is not possible to build sslscan with
support for both.

The primary goal of sslscan is to identify misconfigurations and security
weaknesses in the SSL configuration of a target system, so support for the
legacy ciphers and protocols is much more important than for the newer
(secure) protocols like TLSv1.3 - however over time this will change as
new vulnerabilities are found.

Supporting both SSLv2 an TLSv1.3 in sslscan would either require a fork of
OpenSSL with all the new code backported (which would be increasingly difficult
to maintain over time), or a complete rewrite of sslscan to not rely on the
OpenSSL library. This is not a project that I have the time available for
at present, and if I did, it would probably be a better investment of time
to work on one of the other SSL scanning tools, rather than starting from scratch.

As such, sslscan should be considered  legacy. I will still maintain it as far
as I have time, but it is unlikely to ever support TLSv1.3,  unless an OpenSSL
fork is created by someone else that supports this while maintaining the insecure
crypto that sslscan requires to be useful.

#### Statically linking a custom OpenSSL build

It is possible to ignore the OpenSSL system installation and ship your own
version. Although this results in a more resource-heavy `sslscan` binary
(file size, memory consumption, etc.), this allows to enable both SSLv2 and
SSLv3 ciphers. In comparison to the method of repackaging the
Debian build, this custom OpenSSL build won't affect other tools on the same
system, as they would use the version packaged by the distro's maintainers.

To compile your own OpenSSL version, you'll probably need to install the
OpenSSL build dependencies:

    apt-get install build-essential git zlib1g-dev
    apt-get build-dep openssl

then run

    make static

which will clone the [OpenSSL repository](https://github.com/openssl/openssl),
and configure/compile/test OpenSSL prior to compiling `sslscan`.

**Please note:** Out of the box, OpenSSL cannot compiled with `clang` without
further customization (which is not done by the provided `Makefile`).
For more information on this, see [Modifying Build Settings](http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation#Modifying_Build_Settings)
in the OpenSSL wiki.

You can verify whether you have a statically linked OpenSSL version, if

    ./sslscan --version

looks a bit like

        1.x.y-...-static
        OpenSSL 1.0.2-chacha xx XXX xxxx

(pay attention to the `-static` suffix and the `1.0.2-chacha` OpenSSL version).


#### Building on Kali
Kali now ships with a statically built version of sslscan which supports SSLv2.

The package can be found in the [Kali Git Repository](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/sslscan).

If for whatever reason you can't install this package, follow the instructions
above for statically building against OpenSSL.

#### Building on Debian
It is recommended that you statically build sslscan using the instructions listed
above. If this is not an option and you want to compile your system OpenSSL
with support for legacy protocols such as SSLv2 and SSLv3 then follow the
instructions below.

Note that many modern distros (including Debian) ship with a version of OpenSSL
that disables support for SSLv2 ciphers. If `sslscan` is compiled on one of
these distros, it will not be able to detect SSLv2.

This issue can be resolved by rebuilding OpenSSL from source after removing
the patch that disables SSLv2 support.

The `build_openssl_debian.sh` script automates this process for Debian systems.
It has been tested on Debian Squeeze/Wheezy; it may work on other
Debian based distros, but has not been tested. The built version of OpenSSL
will be installed using `dpkg`.

If it is not possible to rebuild OpenSSL, `sslscan` will still compile
(thanks to a patch from [digineo/sslscan](https://github.com/digineo/sslscan),
based on the debian patch). However, a warning will be displayed in the
output to notify the user that SSLv2 ciphers will not be detected.

# Original (ioerror) README
This is a fork of sslscan.c to better support STARTTLS.

The original home page of sslscan is:

    http://www.titania.co.uk

sslscan was originally written by:

    Ian Ventura-Whiting

The current home page of this fork (until upstream merges a finished patch) is:

    http://www.github.com/ioerror/sslscan

Most of the pre-TLS protocol setup was inspired by the OpenSSL s_client.c
program. The goal of this fork is to eventually merge with the original
project after the STARTTLS setup is polished.

Some of the OpenSSL setup code was borrowed from The Tor Project's Tor program.
Thus it is likely proper to comply with the BSD license by saying:
