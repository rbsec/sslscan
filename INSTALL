Requirements:
   OpenSSL 0.9.8o or better

Makefile build:
      make
      make install        (as root)

Manual Build:
   sslscan can be built manually using the following
   commands:

      gcc -lssl -o sslscan sslscan.c
      clang -lssl -o sslscan sslscan.c

There are two ways to build a Windows executable:

  1.) By cross-compiling on a Linux build machine using MinGW or Mingw-w64.

  2.) By compiling on a Windows build machine using Visual Studio 2013
      (other versions may also work, but are untested).

  If you have a Debian-like Linux machine (such as Ubuntu or Kali), option
#1 is BY FAR the easiest.  Note that installing Visual Studio and additional
tools requires downloading gigabytes of data!

  In any case, it is necessary to compile OpenSSL to ensure that all
protocols and algorithms are enabled (note that some systems that package
OpenSSL have some deprecated features such as SSLv2 turned off for safety
reasons; we actually need those to test with).

Please note that building on Windows (especially x86) is not supported, and
you may well encounter issues when trying to do so. Cross-compiling for x86
from Debian Buster (10) is reported to work, but your mileage may vary.


I. Cross-compiling from Linux

  A. Building a 64-bit Windows executable

    0.) Install Mingw-w64.  On Debian-like systems, this can be done with:
        apt-get install mingw-w64

    1.) Compile sslscan.  It will download the OpenSSL sources from GitHub
        automatically:
        make -f Makefile.mingw


  B. Building a 32-bit Windows executable

    0.) Install MinGW.  On Debian-like systems, this can be done with:
        apt-get install mingw32

    1.) Compile sslscan.  It will download the OpenSSL sources from GitHub
        automatically:
        make -f Makefile.mingw BUILD_32BIT=1


II. Compiling on Windows using Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows Desktop

  A. Install Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows Desktop:
         http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9832280

  B. Install the Windows Driver Kit 8.1:
         http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=393659

  C. Install ActivePerl Community Edition:
         http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads

  D. In the VS2013 x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt, compile OpenSSL with:
    perl Configure VC-WIN64A
    ms\do_win64a
    nmake -f ms\nt.mak

  E. Inside the sslscan folder, compile sslscan with:
    nmake -f Makefile.vs OPENSSL_PATH=path/to/openssl
