.TH SSLSCAN 1 "December 30, 2013"
.SH NAME
sslscan \- Fast SSL/TLS scanner
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sslscan
.RI [ options ] " [host:port | host]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B sslscan
command
.PP
\fBsslscan\fP queries SSL/TLS services, such as HTTPS, in order to determine the
ciphers that are supported.

SSLScan is designed to be easy, lean and fast. The output includes preferred
ciphers of the SSL/TLS service, and text and XML output formats are supported. It is TLS SNI aware when used with a supported version of OpenSSL.

Output is colour coded to indicate security issues. Colours are as follows:

Red Background  NULL cipher (no encryption)
.br
Red             Broken cipher (<= 40 bit), broken protocol (SSLv2 or SSLv3) or broken certificate signing algorithm (MD5)
.br
Yellow          Weak cipher (<= 56 bit or RC4) or weak certificate signing algorithm (SHA-1)
.br
Purple          Anonymous cipher (ADH or AECDH)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-help
.br
Show summary of options
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show version of program
.TP
.B \-\-targets=<file>
A file containing a list of hosts to
check. Hosts can be supplied with
ports (i.e. host:port). One target per line
.TP
.B \-\-ipv4
.br
Force IPv4 DNS resolution.
Default is to try IPv4, and if that fails then fall back to IPv6.
.TP
.B \-\-ipv6
.br
Force IPv6 DNS resolution.
Default is to try IPv4, and if that fails then fall back to IPv6.
.TP
.B \-\-show\-certificate
Display certificate information.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-check\-certificate
Don't flag certificates signed with weak algorithms (MD5 and SHA-1) or short (<2048 bit) RSA keys
.TP
.B \-\-failed
Show rejected ciphers
(default is to listing only accepted ciphers)
.TP
.B \-\-ssl2
.br
Only check SSLv2 ciphers
.br
Note that this option may not be availalbe if system OpenSSL does not support SSLv2. Either build OpenSSL statically or rebuild your system OpenSSL with SSLv2 support. See the readme for further details.
.TP
.B \-\-ssl3
.br
Only check SSLv3 ciphers
.br
Note that this option may not be availalbe if system OpenSSL does not support SSLv3. Either build OpenSSL statically or rebuild your system OpenSSL with SSLv3 support. See the readme for further details.
.TP
.B \-\-tls10
.br
Only check TLS 1.0 ciphers
.TP
.B \-\-tls11
.br
Only check TLS 1.1 ciphers
.TP
.B \-\-tls12
.br
Only check TLS 1.2 ciphers
.TP
.B \-\-tlsall
.br
Only check TLS ciphers (versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2)
.TP
.B \-\-pk=<file>
A file containing the private key or
a PKCS#12 file containing a private
key/certificate pair (as produced by
MSIE and Netscape)
.TP
.B \-\-pkpass=<password>
The password for the private key or PKCS#12 file
.TP
.B \-\-certs=<file>
A file containing PEM/ASN1 formatted client certificates
.TP
.B \-\-no\-ciphersuites
Only check for supported SSL/TLS versions, not ciphersuites
.TP
.B \-\-no\-renegotiation
Do not check for secure TLS renegotiation
.TP
.B \-\-no\-compression
Do not check for TLS compression (CRIME)
.TP
.B \-\-no\-heartbleed
Do not check for OpenSSL Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160)
.TP
.B \-\-starttls\-ftp
STARTTLS setup for FTP
.TP
.B \-\-starttls\-imap
STARTTLS setup for IMAP
.TP
.B \-\-starttls\-pop3
STARTTLS setup for POP3
.TP
.B \-\-starttls\-smtp
STARTTLS setup for SMTP
.br
Note that some servers hang when we try to use SSLv3 ciphers over STARTTLS. If you scan hangs, try using the --tlsall option.
.TP
.B \-\-starttls\-xmpp
STARTTLS setup for XMPP
.TP
.B \-\-rdp
.br
Send RDP preamble before starting scan.
.TP
.B \-\-html
.br
Makes a HTML request after a successful connection and returns
the server response code
.TP
.B \-\-bugs
.br
Enables workarounds for SSL bugs
.TP
.B \-\-timeout=<sec>
.br
Set socket timeout. Useful for hosts that fail to respond to ciphers they don't understand. Default is 3s.
.TP
.B \-\-sleep=<msec>
.br
Pause between connections. Useful on STARTTLS SMTP services, or anything else that's performing rate limiting. Defaultis disalbed.
.TP
.B \-\-xml=<file>
.br
Output results to an XML file
.br
.TP
.B \-\-no-colour
.br
Disable coloured output.
