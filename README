This is a fork of sslscan.c to better support STARTTLS.

The original home page of sslscan is:

    http://www.titania.co.uk

sslscan was originally written by:

    Ian Ventura-Whiting

The current home page of this fork (until upstream merges a finished patch) is:

    http://www.github.com/ioerror/sslscan

Most of the pre-TLS protocol setup was inspired by the OpenSSL s_client.c
program. The goal of this fork is to eventually merge with the original
project after the STARTTLS setup is polished.

Some of the OpenSSL setup code was borrowed from The Tor Project's Tor program.
